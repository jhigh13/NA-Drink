Your goal is to generate a functional spec for implementing a feature based on the provided idea:

<idea>
Generate a non alcoholic beverage recommendation for health conscience individuals looking to moderate alcohol consumption with AI. 

- It should take in the user's favorite alcoholic beverages
- Based on the beverage preferences (non alcoholic beer, non alcoholic wine, ready to drink mocktails, or homemadae mocktails), 
    it should generate non alcoholic beverage recommendations
- The recommendations should include ingredients, calories, other potential added health information, and links to buy the drink. 
- Use OpenAI APIs to generate the plan
</idea>

Before generating the spec plan, be sure to review the [file](../../docs/proposal.md) file to understand an overview of the project.

RULES:
- Start by defining the user journey steps as simple as possible
- Number functional requirements sequentially
- Include acceptance criteria for each functional requirement
- Use clear, concise language
- Aim to keep user journey as few steps as possible to accomplish tasks
- Keep the UI simple and easy to digest

NEXT:

- Ask me for feedback to make sure I'm happy
- Give me additional things to consider I may not be thinking about

FINALLY:

When satisfied:

- Output your plan in [folder](../../docs/specs/feature-name.md)
- DO NOT start writing any code or implementation plans. Follow instructions.
